Variable type is a menu drop down selection of String, Date, SHA-256, IP Address, sophosPID, URL. Registry Key, File Path, Device Name, Username.
  
Value is determined by the variable type. Items like Date will give you a menu option, otherwise, you manually enter the value. You can use wildcards here (%).
  
Version number and dates are kept to help maintain the integrity of the code. 

If changes occur to Sophos Central XDR schema that causes a failure, I will do my best to stay on top of them, but reach out with the repo link and screen of the error described to notifications@kopacko.us.
  
### Disclaimer
  
The queries are not supported via Sophos Support Channels and are provided "as-is."
